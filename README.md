This Library serves as a wrapper to several of the functions
provided by the capstone.CsInsn instruction class.

The focus of this library is to support x86_64 and thus has
not been tested for any other architecture.

Installation
------------
- Ensure that `capstone >= 3.0.3`
- Some features require `capstone == 4.0.x`


Usage Examples
--------------
TODO. Right now you'll have to look at the source code.
